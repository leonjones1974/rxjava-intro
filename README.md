## RX Intro

The contents of this repository are designed to guide you through the basic of RX.  It doesn't aim to provide 'all the answers', rather it tries to gradually paint a picture and hopefully guide and focus your own experimentation

### How to use this guide?

* Clone this repo
* Run ./gradlew idea to generate an intellij project (or import if you prefer)
* Open in intellij
* Follow each of the (currently 6) examples in order, reading the appropriate readme first
* Each example is comprised of tests that, from top-to-bottom, gradually illustrate the topic on which the example is focussed
* All the tests have horrible sleeps.  Don't run them all at once!  Run them one at a time, look at the output, work out what it means


### What's next

* Certainly a section on testing
* Anything else that people think should be included
