## Temporal Operations

All of that's mildly interesting.
  
So far we have found a nice, composable way to transform, filter and project our streams
We have touched upon a way we can receive notification of errors in the stream
We have looked (briefly) at how we can manage the lifetime of our underlying resources by subscribing/ unsubscribing

### What now?  

Time plays a far more important role when working with streams.  RX comes with a heap of operators to allow us to reason about streams over time

Example 2 introduces a few common temporal stream processing patterns
